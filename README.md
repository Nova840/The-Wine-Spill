# The-Wine-Spill

The Wine Spill is a Sinatra based web application that was a clone of stack overflow but wine related. Users can add questions, which can then be answered by other users. Those questions and answers are also commentable by users. Questions, answers and comments are votable by users, which increases or decreases the vote count on that object. This application was created by [Leo Kukhar](https://github.com/leokukhar), [Saralis Rivera](https://github.com/sarariv), [Adam Zmudzinski](https://github.com/Nova840), [David Walden](https://github.com/d-walden) and [Ayaz Uddin](https://github.com/Ayaz2589).
